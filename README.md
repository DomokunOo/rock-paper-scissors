Had trouble with scope, event listens and anonymous functions.

Dealt with inconsistencies of game with back button and play button not resetting game. Wroked with play again, start, and restart button inconsistencies when not working as intended. For example, Play Again button should only work when a game is finished (not before the game starts, not during the game etc.).

Dealt with CSS styling using js to show/hide elements/text/items. Hard one was the 3 icons of rock paper scissors for player to select (event listen and getting the value of the icon ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors'] to match the computerSelection).

Spent some time dealing with counters/resetting counters because scope of function problems. Resetting game and stopping game was quite difficult, adding and removing event listens.

learned showing and hiding pages/elements and more familiar with flex and placing elements where I want them in CSS

Duration of project: ~3-4 days

INSTRUCTIONS:

RUN ONLY domversionupdate.html
index.html does not work, only prompts and logs game.
